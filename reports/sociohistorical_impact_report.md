## Socio-Historical Context and Impact Report

### Socio-Historical Context

The connection between access to nutritious food and academic performance can’t be fully understood without looking at the historical context that shaped our current food and education systems. Decades of redlining, racially discriminatory housing policies, and uneven investment in infrastructure have left lasting marks on many communities, especially those predominantly made up of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous residents. These policies helped create what we now call "food deserts" — areas where fresh, affordable food is hard to access—and these same communities have often faced underfunded public schools and fewer academic resources (Rothstein, 2017).

This project has real implications for several key groups: students living in food deserts, educators and school districts, local and federal policymakers, and public health advocates. Our findings could inform programs that aim to close achievement gaps by improving access to basic needs like food and nutrition. But there’s also a risk that our results could be misinterpreted or used to reinforce negative assumptions about certain racial or socioeconomic groups if we don’t communicate them responsibly. Past research—such as studies by the USDA and educational think tanks—has already shown that poor nutrition can affect memory, attention, and overall academic performance (USDA ERS, 2023 and Basch, 2011). Our project builds on these findings by analyzing how the severity of food access issues might relate to outcomes at the county level.

Given this context, it’s important that we frame our work around systems—not individuals. Rather than suggesting that students in food deserts are inherently less capable, our goal is to highlight how structural inequalities in food access might be contributing to educational disparities and to support broader conversations about equity and reform.

Understanding the socio-historical context has shifted our framing away from questions about individual performance and toward a focus on structural barriers like systemic racism, economic inequality, and geographic segregation. In analyzing our data, this context reminds us not to treat race or income as isolated variables, but as proxies for a range of interlocking factors like school funding, neighborhood safety, and access to healthcare. It also encourages us to interpret our findings with caution—correlation is not causation, and the disparities we observe are not due to inherent differences between groups, but to unequal conditions created by history and policy. Finally, in presenting our results, we’ve prioritized clarity, transparency, and care, making sure that our language doesn’t stigmatize communities but instead highlights the need for equity-driven interventions.


### Ethical Considerations

Because we’re using large public datasets with over 900,000 census tracts across the country that aggregate information about people’s race, location, and test scores, it’s important to think carefully about how these data were collected and what assumptions might be built into them. For example, educational performance data often rely on standardized tests, which have long been criticized for favoring certain cultural and economic backgrounds (Au, 2009). Similarly, the way food deserts are defined—based on distance to supermarkets or poverty thresholds—might miss important nuances, like whether the available food is actually affordable or culturally appropriate. These census tracts were grouped based on a specific definition of food deserts (including low access tracts when considering 1/2 mile distance for urban areas vs low access tracts when considering 10 mile distance for rural areas), which is important to consider for our analysis (USDA ERS, 2023).

We also have to be careful in how we interpret and present our analysis to avoid potential interpretation biases. Correlations between food deserts and academic outcomes might reflect a wide range of underlying issues, like generational poverty or differences in school funding, not just food access alone. If we ignore those complexities, we risk drawing overly simple or even misleading conclusions. As researchers, we also bring our own biases and perspectives to the work, and it's important to acknowledge that we’re not from the communities we're studying.

Several ethical concerns shaped our decisions throughout the project. Our interpretation of the data may carry biases stemming from our academic training, positionality, and assumptions about what constitutes “academic success.” We risk overemphasizing standardized test scores without acknowledging how these metrics may reflect resource disparities more than student ability. For example, when considering our analysis of academic achievement across race groups, we try our best to simply present the results as compared with sleep deprivation + food desert prevalence data, without making additional assumptions or reinforcing academic stereotypes across these racial groups. However, our analysis aggregates data at the census tract level rather than the overall county level, which effectively considers variation within communities and potentially overlook the experiences of more vulnerable subgroups. Finally, we recognize that our results could be misused—for example, by implying that low performance is caused by communities themselves rather than systemic deprivation. To mitigate this, we’ve framed our conclusions within the context of structural inequities and emphasized that our goal is to inform policies that address root causes of educational disparities.

To address these concerns, we’ve tried to be transparent about our methods and clear about the limits of our data. We’ve avoided framing our results in a way that blames individuals or communities, and instead focused on how larger systems create and maintain these inequalities. Our hope is that this project contributes to a more informed and empathetic conversation about how to address both food insecurity and educational inequality.
